# COVID-19-TOP-TEN-Santa-Clara-Cases-2020
      In this project, I set out to use the data from Santa Clara's County Public Health data for the COVID-19 cases across Santa Clara County from 2020. Using data science libraries in python, and the help of the public records accessed over SCCPH databases. I wrote the code and cleaned and visualized it using Matplotlib, pandas, and plotly. To minimize and clean up the charts used, I took the top ten zip codes across Santa Clara to visualize the cases by zip codes. With the help and collaboration from fellow programmers and LLM machines.
